Here is a repository where I will share some of the tutorials we go over throughout the semester! 

### Tutorial 1:
Introduction to basic Scanpy functions: clustering, dimensionality reduction, data visualization, preprocessing, etc. Introduces the formulation of some fundamental ML techniques for gene expression data analysis including PCA and KMeans clustering. Also illustrates the poor performance of naively applying these methods to spatially resolved data.

### Tutorial 2:
TBA
